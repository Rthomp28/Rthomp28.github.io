                    <h2>An Unfinished Tale of Surfing the American Continents</h2>
                    <p>It was a cold morning when I trundled up in my Hiace to the lot near Mitre 10 in Torquay, and as I pushed the glass 
                        door open to Corey Graham’s shop it was clear there’d be no one waiting to greet me. Racks full of hand-shaped boards, 
                        walls full of art, and emanating from somewhere deep in the back, I could hear Kyuss turned up loud amongst the muffled 
                        whirl of a sander.</p>
                    <p>Found him deep in dust, working hard on a memorabilia board for the Bells comp starting in a couple of days - it was 
                        Easter time. The whirring slowed as I approached the door. Tools down. Big smile. Bit of a tour around the shaping bay 
                        and the latest prototypes. Me quietly frothing.
                    </p>

                    <p>“So what can I do for ya Matty?”</p>
                    <p>“…Well I’ve kinda got this idea…” I trailed off, and then grinned…</p>
                    <p>“I’m going on a trip. It’s kind of a long one. Y’see…I’m thinking I’m gonna try and ride a motorcycle from the Arctic Ocean 
                        in northern Alaska, along the Pacific coastline of the Americas down south, like really south – hopefully to Patagonia in 
                        Argentina… and I want to surf the whole way - sort of…”  I spat the words out, all question-like, almost expecting a laugh 
                        in response.</p>
                    <p>“Wow… that’s bloody awesome.”  Corey’s eyes lit up and wandered to the ceiling, his hand stroked his chin.</p>
                    <p>I watched him for a moment, waiting for a response...he looked as if he was imagining far off worlds…  It was on. He got it.</p>

                    <p>We spent the morning talking excitedly about the places the boards would visit, an almost endless list of beaches united by 
                        that one epic ocean. I explained how over the last few years I’d been exploring shapes outside of the standard HPS 
                        – Corey wrung his hands smiling.</p>
                    <p>“Sweet – so good to hear mate, ‘cos that’s what really gets me frothing.”</p>
                    <p>I explained that if I was planning on surfing only two boards for the next two years of the journey, I wanted them to feel as 
                        versatile as possible. I needed two boards for any scenario. I’m a 6’3 lanky guy with moderate to lanky surfing skills, so we 
                        decided on a 5'10" single-fling 4 + 1 all-rounder, and a 7'2" 6-channel widow-maker singlefin with stabilisers…for when it gets good.
